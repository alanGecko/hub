            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I like building random projects and often forget about them later.
                I tend to be pretty forgetful and I will propably forget you exist in a week<br>.
                If you like any of my projects and you want me to continue working on them let me know.<br>
                If you want me to build something for you, I might consider it.
                I am new so don't expect too much from me.
                Also don't be a prick and steal my work.<br>
                Oh also I am the founder and president of Geako Productions.<br>
                Not to brag but we make a whole $0 a year.

                <h2>My likes and intrests</h2>
                <p>My intrests shift all the time, like all the time and I am always getting hyperfixated on something.
                    Some things I like alot though would be touhou, VOCALOID, UTAU, music, and programming.<br>
                    I'm pretty nerdy but if you are rude I will bite you, and if you like that (you freak) then I'll do something else very aggressively.
                    I like animals. <button class="maaaa" onclick="maaaa()">[insert loud farm noises here lol]</button></p>
